    <h2>A gas station has opened in the south side of the city.</h2>
    <p>Just today a gas station has opened in the city, with '15 pumps', and '5 charging stations'.</p>
    <p>The station also has a car wash, <em>and</em> a place to fill your tires with air, as well as plently of food and drink inside.</p>
    <p>I'm very excited to see the traffic that this new store will bring to the city. A local man stated <q>I think this will be good for our city.</q></p>
